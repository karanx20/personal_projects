        <p>Shah Rukh Khan
    </b> (pronounced [ˈʃɑːɦɾʊx xɑːn]; born 2 November 1965), also known by the initialism SRK,<br> is an Indian actor, film
    producer, and television personality who works in Hindi films. Referred to in the media as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padishah">"Baadshah of
    Bollywood"</a> (in reference to his 1999 film Baadshah),<br> "King of Bollywood" and "King Khan", he has appeared in more
    than 80 films, and earned numerous accolades, including 14 Filmfare Awards. The Government of India has awarded him
    the Padma Shri, and the Government of France has awarded him the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and the Legion of
    Honour. Khan has a significant following in Asia and the Indian diaspora worldwide. In terms of audience size and
    income, he has been described as one of the most successful film stars in the world.</p>
    <p>Khan began his career with appearances in several television series in the late 1980s. He made his Bollywood
        debut in 1992 with Deewana. Early in his career, Khan was recognised for portraying villainous roles in the
        films Baazigar (1993), Darr (1993), and Anjaam (1994). He then rose to prominence after starring in a series of
        romantic films, including Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai
        (1998), Mohabbatein (2000) and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001). Khan went on to earn critical acclaim for his
        portrayal of an alcoholic in Devdas (2002), a NASA scientist in Swades (2004), a hockey coach in Chak De! India
        (2007) and a man with Asperger syndrome in My Name Is Khan (2010). His highest-grossing films include the
        comedies Chennai Express (2013), Happy New Year (2014), Dilwale (2015), and the crime film Raees (2017). Many of
        his films display themes of Indian national identity and connections with diaspora communities, or gender,
        racial, social and religious differences and grievances.<sup><a href="go for 100"> [x100]</a></sup>
